# Greetings!

I am a junior Software Engineer for the division of IT at North Dakota State University. I earned my Bachelor's of Science
in Computer Science in December of 2020.

Prior to school I was an Arena Attendant for Bismarck Parks and Recreation primarily
driving the Zamboni for hockey practices and games. My time spent away from academia really gave me time to think about what
I actually wanted to pursue a career in.

I have a few hobbies but currently I'm big into golf and cannot wait for Battlefield 2042 to come out!

I'm a spouse and proud father of Kai Avery, my 2 and a half year-old son.
