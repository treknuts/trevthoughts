# The Perly Barn...

For several years now, my step-father-in-law (wow) has been renovating an old farmstead in rural North Dakota. His grand scheme
is to set this property up as a wedding venue. In the digital age he is going to need a website to market his product/services
and sell them online.

That's where I come in. Rather than hiring a firm or paying for something like SquareSpace. He's elected to hire his newbie
son-in-law to put together a site for him. Against my parents golden rule of "don't do business with family" I've decided to
take this project on.

Although it will undoubtedly be a lot of work I can't help but feel like this will be a great way to get my foot in the door
of freelance work. Which will be a great way to supplement my income from my full-time job. As well as explore new technologies
apart from those used at work.

For this project I've elected to use the following technologies:

- Frontend: Gatsby (The reason I'm doing this tutorial) (Also I'm familiar with React so shallow learning curve)
- Backend: tbd. Top picks are Express, Laravel, or Spring. I have professional experience with Laravel and Spring so idk.
- Database: No clue. I'd like to learn MongoDB a little better but MySQL is always an easy choice depending on the complexity.
- Styling: ThemeUI? Maybe? Vanilla CSS works well enough so idk.
- Payments: Stripe (ezpz)
- Calendar: React Big Calendar (Assuming it works with Gatsby. Otherwise, browse Gatsby plugins.)
- Hosting: Gatsby Cloud
