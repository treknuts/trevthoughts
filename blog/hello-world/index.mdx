# Hello, World

This is essential my developer diary starting at the very beginning of my career as a Software Engineer
at North Dakota State University. **Roll herd!**

## What to expect

I'll more than likely vent about work projects I may not be enjoying (PCR junk). Also, I have several personal/freelance
projects up my sleeve that I'll be talking about.
